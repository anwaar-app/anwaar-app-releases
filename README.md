Anwaar app is a search engine for the Hadith of Prophet Muhammad (saww) and Ahl al-Bayt (as) in Arabic and English.

The app contains the following features:
- Search for Hadith: searching can be done using phrases from the Hadith text, and it is possible to filter the search results by choosing the sayer or by choosing several topics.
- Browse Topics and Search for Topic: these two features allow exploring all included Hadith.
- Hadith of the Day: it is possible to enable a daily notification as reminder to read the Hadith of the day.
- Favorites: this feature allows adding any Hadith to the list of favorites so that it can be easily found at a later time.
- Browse Group: this feature allows browsing a group of Hadith regularly and to add notification reminders to do so.
- Random Browsing: this feature allows displaying a random group of Hadith.
- Topic Links: this feature makes it easy to discover related topics.

Count of Hadith in Arabic: 4000
Count of Hadith in English: 1000

Insha'Allah the app will be regularly updated to add more Hadith, to add new features, and to resolve any bugs.
